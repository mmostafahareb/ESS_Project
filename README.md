- `deep_learning.ipynb`: deep learning model using Keras

## Battery Description

The LiNiMnCo/Graphite cells used in this project are cylindrical INR 18650-20R batteries with a capacity rating of 2000 mAh, and a cell chemistry of LiNiMnCo/Graphite. The batteries have a weight of 45 g, diameter of 18.33 mm ± 0.07 mm, and length of 64.85 mm ± 0.15 mm. Tab length is not included in the dimensions.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the following paper:

### Feature Engineering

By examining the coefficients of the Lasso Regression model, we can see that the two most important features for predicting SoH are `Discharge_Q` (major predictor) and `Capacity dV CCCT` (minor predictor). 

`Discharge_Q` represents the discharge capacity of the battery, or the amount of charge that can be extracted from the battery under certain conditions. As the battery ages, its capacity decreases, leading to a decrease in SoH. Therefore, it makes sense that this feature would be a major predictor of SoH.

`Capacity dV CCCT` represents the change in voltage during a discharge cycle, and is used as a measure of capacity fade. As the battery ages, its capacity decreases, leading to a decrease in voltage during discharge. Therefore, it also makes sense that this feature would be a predictor of SoH.
